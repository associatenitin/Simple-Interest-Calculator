## Overview

This application allows users to calculate **Simple Interest (SI)** quickly. It's useful for students, financial professionals, or anyone needing to perform basic interest calculations.

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

> **SI = (P * R * T) / 100**

Where:
- `P` = Principal Amount
- `R` = Rate of Interest per year
- `T` = Time (in years)

## Features

- Easy to use
- Input validation for all parameters
- Supports integer and decimal values for principal, rate, and time
- Command-line and/or web-based interface (depending on the implementation)

## Formula

The formula for calculating **Simple Interest** is:

> **Simple Interest = (Principal * Rate * Time) / 100**

Where:
- **Principal (P)**: The amount of money you start with.
- **Rate (R)**: The interest rate per annum (in percentage).
- **Time (T)**: The time period for which the interest is calculated (in years).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-interest-calculator.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd simple-interest-calculator
   ```

For Python implementation:
3. Install dependencies (if any):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

For web-based implementation:
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

### Command Line

To calculate Simple Interest, run the following command:

```bash
python simple_interest.py
```

You will be prompted to enter the values for **Principal**, **Rate**, and **Time**. The program will then display the calculated Simple Interest.

### Web Interface

Open `index.html` in a web browser and enter the values for **Principal**, **Rate**, and **Time** in the respective fields. Click on "Calculate" to see the result.

## Examples

### Example 1: 

For a Principal of 1000, Rate of 5%, and Time of 2 years:
```
P = 1000, R = 5%, T = 2 years
Simple Interest = (1000 * 5 * 2) / 100 = 100
```

### Example 2: 

For a Principal of 1500, Rate of 3.5%, and Time of 1.5 years:
```
P = 1500, R = 3.5%, T = 1.5 years
Simple Interest = (1500 * 3.5 * 1.5) / 100 = 78.75
```
